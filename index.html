        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
          Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 â€“ October 5, 2011) was an American entrepreneur, industrial designer, business
          magnate, media proprietor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and
          majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition
          of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal
          computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder
          Steve Wozniak.

          Jobs was born in San Francisco in 1955 and adopted shortly afterwards. He attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year. In 1974, he traveled through India, seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to further develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together, the duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers.
